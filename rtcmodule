DS3231 is a RTC (Real Time Clock) module. It is used to maintain the date and time for most of the Electronics projects. This module has its own coin cell power supply using which it maintains the date and time even when the main power is removed or the MCU has gone through a hard reset. So, once we set the date and time in this module it will keep track of it always. In our circuit, we are using DS3231 to feed the pet according to the time, set up by the Pet’s owner, like an alarm. As, clock reaches the set time, it operates the servo motor to rotate the Auger and the food drops in the Pet’s food bowl.
