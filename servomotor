Servo Motor A servo consists of a Motor (DC or AC), a potentiometer, gear assembly and a controlling circuit. First of all, we use gear assembly to reduce RPM and to increase torque of the motor. Say at the initial position of the servo motor shaft, the position of the potentiometer knob is such that there is no electrical signal generated at the output port of the potentiometer. Now an electrical signal is given to another input terminal of the error detector amplifier. Now the difference between these two signals, one comes from potentiometer and another comes from another source, will be processed in a feedback mechanism and output will be provided in terms of error signal. This error signal acts as the input for the motor and motor starts rotating. Now the motor shaft is connected with potentiometer and as motor rotates so the potentiometer and it will generate a signal. So as the potentiometerâ€™s angular position changes, its output feedback signal changes. After sometime the position of potentiometer reaches a position that the output of potentiometer is the same as the external signal provided. At this condition, there will be no output signal from the amplifier to the motor input as there is no difference between external applied signal and the signal generated at potentiometer, and in this situation motor stops rotating.
